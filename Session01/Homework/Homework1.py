# Assignment 1: 
# How to check a variable's type?
    # Python has a function called "type" to check a variable's type. For example:

>>> type("Learning Python is fun!")
<type 'str'>

>>> type(9)
<type 'int'>

# Invalid variable names because of SyntaxError, give 3 different examples of invalid names

    # Case 1: The variable names do not begin with a letter. For example, this variable name below starts with numbers.

        2019year = "Start learning Python"

    # Case 2: The variable names contain an illegal character. For example, this variable name below contain "&" sign.

        drink&food = "Apple juice and KFC"

    # Case 3: The variable names belong to the Python keywords. Keywords define the language's syntax rules and structure, and they cannot be used as variable names. For example, this variable name below is one of the Python keywords "if".

        if = "Python is easy"

# Assignment 2: Write a program that calculates the area of a circle. 

r = float(input("Enter the circle radius:"))
area = 3.14


# Assignment 3: Write a program that converts Celsius (C) into Fahrenheit (F)
